            <h2>API Used</h2>
            I used the Currency Layer API. This API has current and historical data for determining the currency exchange rate for different currencies.
        </p>

        <p>
            <h2>Citation</h2>
            I got my API from https://currencylayer.com/dashboard. The specific link that I used for the exact information I used was: http://api.currencylayer.com/live?access_key=4974a999a14065a6c51228153d2c7a98&currencies=USD,CAD&format=1.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p> 
            <h2>Options</h2>
            I used the live option to access the current exchange data. I also chose to just access the exchange rate between US and Canadian dollars. There are exchange rates for 168 countries, so I chose to limit my access to just this one rate.
        </p>

           <h2>Applications</h2> 
           This API would be helpful if you were travelling between the U.S. and Canada and wanted to know how much money you might need. It would also be helpful if you were buying a product from across the border and needed to know what the cost would be in the units of money that you have access to. I, personally grew up about 30 minutes South of Canada so I have used something like this API a lot, so it would definitely come in handy!
